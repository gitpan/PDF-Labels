PDF::Labels
===========

A geneal purpose tool for laying out sheets and sheet and sheets of labels from most any 
data source you can think of.

This module grew from my need to send Chrismas cards December 2002 only to find that nasty
Apple's Addressbook program doesn't do the mundane - print mailing labels. So I figured out
how to use a couple of the PDF writing modules. Add the need to write labels for other
applications I though I could put together a decent general purpose module. There are other
modules out there but they lack the flexibility I envision.

Features:

  - extensibility
	  - individual labels are generated by a layout package
	  - supplied layout package is pretty smart for simple multi-row labels
  - flexibility
	  - I intend to allow for both explicit data sets for output
		as well as iterators / callbacks
      - ability to skip printing on certain labels (ie/ they've been taken already)
  - longevity
	  - I am gambling that PDF::API2 is the long-term PDF authoring module for Perl
		Why? Perl Graphics Programming - O'Reilly
  - comprehensive
	  - Its companion module - Paper::Specs will have zillions of label formats shortly. :)

WHERE TO GO FROM HERE?
======================

See the examples directory. You are looking at all the documentation right now - v0.02 or
higher will feature documentation. :) 

STATUS
======

 THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE AND SUBJECT TO MAJOR CHANGES

However, saying that, it does work for the most part. :) Failing any huge feedback that
I should do things a different way it will continue essentially in the direction that
it is.
